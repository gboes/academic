Bös, Claudia Cristalli, Fons Dewulf, Ties van Gemert and Nina IJdens",2024,"Bibliometrics beyond citations: introducing mention extraction and analysis",Scientometrics,open access,"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-024-05116-x",,"We introduce mentions as the precursor to formal citations. We discuss additional challenges of working with mention data, in particular disambiguation of homonyms. After introducing several methods to achieve ambiguation, we introduce <i>edhiphy</i>, a data base for the history of philosophy that enriches the extracted mentions with further metadata. It can be interactively explored on <a href='https://edhiphy.org'>edhiphy.org</a>.",,
"Bös, Gregor E.",2024,"A Logical Challenge to Correlationism: The Church-Fitch Paradox in Husserl's Account of Fulfilment, Truth, and Meaning",Synthese,open access,"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-024-04584-1",,"This article argues that a logical paradox constrains how we can understand Husserl's semantics and notion of truth.","Husserl’s theory of fulfilment conceives of empty acts, such as symbolic thought, and fulfilling acts, such as sensory perceptions, in a strict parallel. This parallelism is the basis for Husserl’s semantics, epistemology, and conception of truth. It also entails that any true proposition can be known in principle, which Church and Fitch have shown to explode into the claim that every proposition is actually known. I assess this logical challenge and discuss a recent response by James Kinkaid. While Kinkaid’s proposal saves one direction of the parallel for semantics, it gives up the parallelism for truth. I spell out a different response which meshes naturally with Husserl’s account of meaning. If the parallelism is restricted to a class of basic propositions, the truth of non-basic propositions can be defined inductively, without leading to the paradox. I then discuss objections that have been raised against a similar proposal by Dummett. The result is that exegetically plausible and popular interpretations of Husserl’s correlationism lead to logical paradoxes. But when taking into account the ‘logical adumbration’ of propositional blindspots, truth and possible fulfilment can be connected without paradox.",

Bös, Pedro Teixeira, Thomas Voigt, and Bernhard Knapp",2023,"Short-term Incentives of Research Evaluations: Evidence from the UK Research Excellence Framework",Research Policy,open access,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3083692,,,"We document incentive effects of the evaluation deadlines in the UK’s performance-based research funding system. Studying 3,597,272 publications by UK researchers, we find that publications just before assessment deadlines obtain substantially fewer citations and are published in venues with lower impact factors. These trends reverse abruptly after the deadlines. We discuss different factors that contribute to this observation and provide evidence that evaluation deadlines are likely to set incentives against investment in research quality and long-term topics. We conclude that where such shifts in research incentives are not intended, they might require balancing by additional incentives for exploratory, long-term oriented research.","I wrote the software to match databases and aggregate observables, helped to interpret the findings and contributed to the writing of the article."
