I am also on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/gregorboes.bsky.social "Bluesky account") and [PhilPeople](https://philpeople.org/profiles/gregor-e-bos "PhilPeople Account"), but not active. My ORCID is <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4181-162X">0000-0003-4181-162X</a>. Somehow I also made it onto [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6246223/).

If you spare a moment, please consider visiting [zis-reisen](https://www.zis-reisen.de/en/start/), and tell everyone about our travel scholarships.
