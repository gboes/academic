description: Privacy policy of the academic website of Gregor BÃ¶s.

This is only a simple academic website, but to better understand how it is used and whether it functions as desired, I am using Google Analytics. This serves primarily to monitor visitor and download numbers.

Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that uses cookies. You can read Google's statement about the use of data from partner sites that rely on Google Analytics [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

Beyond the use of Google Analytics, I do not save any visitor data.
