# Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the philosophy department of Tilburg University and an associate member of the Husserl Archives at KU Leuven. I have completed my [PhD](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/founding-science-on-the-lifeworld(405e0ffa-8c83-4ceb-bb04-dbc655b52a42).html "PhD at KCL repository")  in philosophy at King's College London in 2022, and before that obtained degrees in philosophy and physics from LMU Munich.

<!-- Did you ever wonder what the world of your great-grandparents looked like &mdash; to them, not you? Changes in politics and religious beliefs might make for the most dramatic differences, but there are also differences in how we conceive of the natural world.  -->
<!-- I am trying to understand how scientific theories (should) affect the concepts which operate in everyday life.  -->

My PhD thesis focused on the phenomenological notion of *lifeworld* and how to conceive of it in the philosophy of science. This led me to questions ranging from logic, metaphysics, and semantics to the history of philosophy in the 19th and 20th century. I plan to extend the phenomenological discussion of the mathematization of nature into the 21st century, where new conceptual changes are driven by digitalization. 

I have also worked as a data scientist, with interest in Natural Language Processing. I contributed to empirical research on the UK Research Evaluation Framework (with Moqi Groen-Xu et al., 2023 in *Research Policy*, [ doi](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2023.104729) ). At Tilburg University, I am joining [Sander Verhaegh](http://www.sanderverhaegh.nl/)'s ERC project [Exiled Empiricists](https://exiledempiricists.wordpress.com/), which reconstructs the philosophical environment that the Logical Empiricists found when they migrated to the United States. In this context, I am exploring computational methods for the history of philosophy (of science). 

On this website, you can also find a section for [tools](./tools/) that I found useful for philosophy research. I am also lurking on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gregorboes) and, somehow, made it onto [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6246223/).

I also support the <a href="https://zis-reisen.de/en">zis foundation</a> who help young people to grow their agency by funding travel projects. [Contact](./contact/) me to learn more!
