# Welcome

I am a philosophy PhD student at King's College London, working on the intersection of phenomenology and philosophy of science. More specifically, I am currently interested in Husserl's conception of the *lifeworld* of everyday experience and its investigation in empirical science (especially physics).

For now, this website holds a basic [academic CV](./cv/) and a [download](./dl/) section with presentation slides. Draft papers are coming soon!
