# Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at KU Leuven, having completed my [PhD](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/founding-science-on-the-lifeworld(405e0ffa-8c83-4ceb-bb04-dbc655b52a42).html "PhD at KCL repository") at King's College London in 2022, and with a background in philosophy and physics, mostly from LMU Munich.

<!-- Did you ever wonder what the world of your great-grandparents looked like &mdash; to them, not you? Changes in politics and religious beliefs might make for the most dramatic differences, but there are also differences in how we conceive of the natural world.  -->
<!-- I am trying to understand how scientific theories (should) affect the concepts which operate in everyday life.  -->

As a philosopher, I work on the question how (formal) scientific theories (should) affect the concepts which operate in everyday life. 
My PhD thesis focused on the phenomenological notion of *lifeworld* and whether it can find a place in contemporary philosophy of science. This led me to questions ranging from logic, metaphysics, and semantics to the history of philosophy in the 19th and 20th century. To account for the 21st century, I next plan to discuss the conceptual changes occurring through the digitization of society.

I am also interested in Natural Language Processing and have worked as a data scientist. I contributed to empirical research on the influence of the UK Research Evaluation Framework on the publication and citation behaviour of academic researchers (with Moqi Groen-Xu et al., forthcoming in *Research Policy*, [ SSRN preprint ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3083692) ). 

There is also a section for [tools](./tools/) that I found useful for philosophy research. I am also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gregorboes) and, curiously, on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6246223/).

I am always glad to collaborate, discuss philosophy or the brilliant work of the <a href="https://zis-reisen.de/en">zis foundation</a> who help young people to grow their sense of agency &mdash; do not hesitate to [contact](./contact/) me!
