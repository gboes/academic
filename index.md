# Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at KU Leuven, having completed my PhD at King's College London in 2022.

Did you ever wonder what the world of your great-grandparents looked like &mdash; to them, not you? Changes in politics and religious beliefs might make for the most dramatic differences, but there are also differences in how we conceive of the natural world. I am trying to understand how scientific theories (should) affect the concepts which operate in everyday life. My PhD thesis investigated Husserl's concept of the *lifeworld* and its potential for a systematic philosophy of science. This led me to work on questions ranging from logic, metaphysics, and semantics to 19th and 20th century history of philosophy. I plan to expand this project from the focus on scientific theory to include broader conceptual changes through the digitization of society. 
<!-- might introduce here: where I want to go next: digitization and digital society -->

I am also interested in Natural Language Processing and have worked as a data scientist. I contributed to empirical research on the influence of the UK Research Evaluation Framework on the publication and citation behaviour of academic researchers (accepted for publication, [ much earlier draft at SSRN ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3083692) ). 

There is also a section for [tools](./tools/) that I found useful for philosophy research.

I am always glad to collaborate, discuss philosophy or the brilliant work of the <a href="https://zis-reisen.de/en">zis foundation</a> who help young people to grow their sense of agency &mdash; feel free to [contact](./contact/) me!
