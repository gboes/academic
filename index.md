# Welcome

I am a PhD student at the philosophy department of King's College London. My philosophical research revolves around the intersection of philosophy of science and early phenomenology. More specifically, I am interested in Husserl's conception of the *lifeworld* and its prospects as a starting point for phenomenology and philosophy of science. I have also contributed to empirical research on publication and citation patterns across different academic fields (under review, [draft at SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3083692) ).

This site holds an [academic CV](./cv/) and a [download](./dl/) section with slides from presentations. I am also occasionally describing some of the research [tools](./tools/), for which I found it harder to find information &ndash; starting with a setup for reading and annotating academic literature with an Android based [eInk tablet](./tools/ereader "Like paper but digital - an eInk solution for focused reading and writing").

<p> I am always glad to collaborate, discuss philosophy or my work for the [zis foundation](https://zis-reisen.de/en "zis foundation") &ndash; just send me an <a href="mailto:mail@gregorboes.com">email</a>!
