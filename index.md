# Welcome

I am PhD student at the philosophy department of King's College London. My research interests have developed from the intersection of philosophy of science and early phenomenology. More specifically, I am currently interested in Husserl's conception of the *lifeworld* and its prospects as a starting point for phenomenological philosophy, and philosophy of natural science (especially physics). I have also done some empirical research on publication and citation patterns in academia (under review, [draft on SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3083692) ).

For now, this website holds a basic [academic CV](./cv/) and a [download](./dl/) section with presentation slides. I recently added a section for research [tools](./tools/) that I gathered over the last few years. I try to describe only those where it was a harder to find information online &ndash; starting with a setup for reading and annotating with a little known [eInk tablet](./tools/ereader "Like paper but digital - an eInk solution for focused reading and writing").

<p> I am always glad to discuss philosophy, participate in reading groups, or collaborate &ndash; just send me an <a href="mailto:mail@gregorboes.com">email</a>!
