# Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the philosophy department of Tilburg University and an associate member of the Husserl Archives at KU Leuven. I have completed my [PhD](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/founding-science-on-the-lifeworld(405e0ffa-8c83-4ceb-bb04-dbc655b52a42).html "PhD at KCL repository")  in philosophy at King's College London in 2022, and before that obtained degrees in philosophy and physics from LMU Munich.

<!-- Did you ever wonder what the world of your great-grandparents looked like &mdash; to them, not you? Changes in politics and religious beliefs might make for the most dramatic differences, but there are also differences in how we conceive of the natural world.  -->
<!-- I am trying to understand how scientific theories (should) affect the concepts which operate in everyday life.  -->

My philosophical interests are wide, but my research focuses on two topics. The first is to develop phenomenological philosophy in the domain of general philosophy of science and the scientific realism debate.
The second is to leverage new computational methods for the history of philosophy. 

My PhD thesis focused on the phenomenological notion of *lifeworld* and how to conceive of it in the philosophy of science. This led me to questions ranging from logic, metaphysics, and semantics to the history of philosophy in the 19th and 20th century. This is one of the projects that aim to navigate between what Sellars has called the manifest and scientific image of the world. I plan to extend the phenomenological discussion of the mathematization of nature into the 21st century, where new conceptual changes are driven by digitalization. 

Since joining [Sander Verhaegh](http://www.sanderverhaegh.nl/)'s ERC project [Exiled Empiricists](https://exiledempiricists.wordpress.com/), I have developed an <a href="https://edhiphy.org">interactive web-application</a> that makes the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-024-05116-x">edhiphy</a> database accessible to the public. I have also taken over from Eugenio Petrovich the further development of that database. Previously, I also worked as a data scientist and contributed to empirical research on the UK Research Evaluation Framework (with Moqi Groen-Xu, [Research Policy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2023.104729) ). 

This website also has a little section for [tools](./tools/) that I found useful for philosophy research - hoping they might turn out to be useful for others. This section also contains a longer article about setting up a digital reading and annotation workflow with a large Android based ereader from BOOX.

I support the <a href="https://zis-reisen.de/en">zis foundation</a> who help young people to grow their agency by funding travel projects. [Contact](./about/) me to learn more!
