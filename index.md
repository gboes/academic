# Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Tilburg University, having completed my [PhD](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/founding-science-on-the-lifeworld(405e0ffa-8c83-4ceb-bb04-dbc655b52a42).html "PhD at KCL repository")  in philosophy at King's College London in 2022, and degrees in philosophy and physics from LMU Munich.

<!-- Did you ever wonder what the world of your great-grandparents looked like &mdash; to them, not you? Changes in politics and religious beliefs might make for the most dramatic differences, but there are also differences in how we conceive of the natural world.  -->
<!-- I am trying to understand how scientific theories (should) affect the concepts which operate in everyday life.  -->

As a philosopher, I work on the question how (formal) scientific theories (should) affect the concepts which operate in everyday life. 
My PhD thesis focused on the phenomenological notion of *lifeworld* and whether it can find a place in contemporary philosophy of science. This led me to questions ranging from logic, metaphysics, and semantics to the history of philosophy in the 19th and 20th century. My plan is to extend this discussion also to the 21st century, where new conceptual changes are driven by the digitization of society.

I have also worked as a data scientist, with an interest in Natural Language Processing. I contributed to empirical research on the influence of the UK Research Evaluation Framework on the publication and citation behaviour of academic researchers (with Moqi Groen-Xu et al., forthcoming in *Research Policy*, [ SSRN preprint ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3083692) ). At Tilburg University, I am joining [Sander Verhaegh](http://www.sanderverhaegh.nl/)'s ERC project [Exiled Empiricists](https://exiledempiricists.wordpress.com/), which reconstructs the philosophical environment that the Logical Empiricists found when they migrated to the United States. In this context, I will contribute to bibliometric studies and explore computational methods for the history of philosophy (of science).

On this website, you can also find a section for [tools](./tools/) that I found useful for philosophy research. I am also lurking on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gregorboes) and, atom some point, made it to [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6246223/).

I am always glad to collaborate, discuss philosophy or the brilliant work of the <a href="https://zis-reisen.de/en">zis foundation</a> who help young people to grow their sense of agency &mdash; do not hesitate to [contact](./contact/) me!
