# Digital Tools for Philosophy (and related academic work)
In brief: this is an attempt to list (and when I find time, describe) tools that I have found useful for my academic work. If you are interested in reading a longer description of one of the things I mention, or you have a suggestion on your own, please send me an email.


## Why
While there were very good support classes offered for physics students, I did not find much material on digital tools for philosophers. While studying in Tokyo, I took a class in digital humanities, but that resulted only in using a proprietary XML editor to tag a document by hand. A digital humanities class I took in London was better, but had no great payoff either.

In Cambridge there was at least a mention of Zotero, and finally some academics recommended Scrivener. But nobody could help for example to adapt a citation style to use in the humanities. I probably spent more time than would have been wise with methodological considerations. Maybe this time can at least benefit others. The tools I have adopted differ enormously in terms of complexity and payoff. The lowest hanging fruit is to use Zotero as a reference and file manager. If you don't do that yet, stop reading and set it up right now, I cannot see how you could regret it.


## Tools beyond Zotero
### Ereading
The next most useful thing I established is probably my e-reading setup. This is also what I did not find much information (and even some disinformation) on. It's a new market, so there's also a lot of videos around that clearly oversell what ereaders can currently do. But after a lot of research and trial and error, I have found a setup that I am happy with and which I describe here. I should begin by mentioning that this might only be useful to people who do not like reading on backlit screens (like on an iPad). I found it especially helpful for regaining some longer-attention span, slow-thinking time that is so crucial for philosophy. I have written [a little article on my setup](/tools/ereader "Article on my ereader setup").

### Emacs
Adopting emacs as my text-editor is by a great margin the most complex tool that I have adopted, it is probably overkill for most people working in the humanities. But it also has real potential, and if it were a little more user-friendly, with better introductions, it wouldn't be as off-putting. With the introduction of Windows WSL, the performance has improved drastically as well, and doom emacs makes the configuration much simpler. Still, it remains a complex tool.
But you might find it has enough potential to justify the effort. In particular, org-roam is great and has immensely changed how I organise ideas and even reduced anxiety about forgetting ideas and losing notes. Especially those who have heard of [Luhmann's Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) (that's almost always sociologists) might be interested.

### LaTeX
I mostly use LaTeX for my academic work, just because it gives me more freedom and modularity than Word for example. I also like the idea of seeing version-control differences in my thesis with git, but I guess there would be ways to achieve something similar with a word processor. In short, I totally understand why many people prefer to avoid it.

Be that as it may, I ended up cobbling together a XeLaTeX Beamer style with KCL's corporate design, to create my academic presentations (see [downloads](/dl/)). Because of the excellent synergy between emacs' org-mode and LaTeX, I am still using it to write my PhD thesis and normal papers. I have not planned to add a detailed description of this setup, but who knows.
If you depend heavily on logic, it of course makes sense to learn LaTeX, but formula editors in other solutions are catching up. And I don't know if that is enough reason to write everything in TeX.



<!-- ## Open Source -->
<!-- One of the many things that distinguished my studies in physics from those of philosophy was the presence and awareness of digital tools for research.  -->
<!-- It might be a particularity of German academia, and maybe the physics community, that a lot of emphasis was placed on the use of open source tools.  -->
<!-- All departmental workstations, as well as those used in the Max-Planck Institute for Physics were as a matter of course running Ubuntu (and a KDE desktop) -->

<!-- It might have even been something more local about Munich. It is the only city whose administration ran in a tailor-made open source environment (with its own distribution, LiMux). So it is probably a fertile ground for Open Source enthusiasts. But the different fields seem to play their part: When I started a new research assistant job at the Max-Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition -- populated mostly by economists and legal researchers -- the computing environment was built on Windows 7 again. -->

<!-- In this article, I list all open source tools hat I regularly use (and this is not because they're free - I do not mind paying for a tool if it does a job better). Maybe there are some that are not well enough known - like the lovely little *briss* that lets you crop pdfs and split pages in a very smart way - for anyone scanning books, a godsend. -->

<!-- [Here](/tools/floss/) is a  simple list of open source software that I am using. -->





<!-- ## Hosting a personal website on github pages / jekyll -->
<!-- There are simpler solutions. But having version control built in is nice, and it was quite educational to set this up. But I don't think I have very strong opinions about this; just that it feels much nicer to know _mostly_ what is happening on your website, and not having to deal with all the hidden stuff that comes with wordpress. And of course already using emacs makes writing markdown comparatively nice. -->
