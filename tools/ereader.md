# Like paper, but practical - an ereading setup for academic reading and writing

> This little article describes how I use a Boox Max 3 in conjunction with Zotero to read and synchronize pdfs and their annotation.
> TL;DR: For some years, I could not quite achieve a completely digital workflow for reading and writing. Now I am finally happy, with a setup built around the Boox Max 3. Things I like about this: extreme mobility and the possibility to work outside, less eyestrain, consistent digital annotations, and fewer distractions. There is also great potential to change the writing process and note taking, both by longhand and typing.

I vividly remember the first time I entered the Knightsbridge professor's office. It was an enviable place to work in. But despite the room's impressive size, it was filled to the brim: spines of books covered every bit of wall. I was hoping that one day, I'd amass a similar collection.

But having moved back and forth as a student, living in a tiny room, knowing the financial prospects of an academic career, I could not really see how. Besides the cost of acquisition, already the _physical challenge_ of taking care and keeping track of such a physical library seemed unachievable. When I moved from Munich to London (let alone from Munich to Japan), I had to make a heartbreaking selection of which books to take and which to miss a month later. And as Hermes lost one of the two boxes I sent, the greater part of them never arrived. <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> Meanwhile, my parents had long lost track of the books with strange titles that kept filling up every little corner. 

Although the physical library has a great romantic appeal (and makes for a great zoom background), I had long hoped that there would be a better way to work with academic philosophy. The technology for it was a long time coming and I saw no reason why it shouldn't work. But my previous attempts, with Kindles and an expensive and niche devices, like the Boox M96, all failed. But on my most recent run, I finally built a solution that I am happy with. If the problem seems familiar to you, and you are not afraid of losing a physical representation of your intellect, you might want to read on.

## What exactly is the problem
Philosophy obviously involves a lot of reading. Physical reading material presents a number of problems:
- lack of mobility (also requires e.g. choosing which books to bring into a library)
- no backups
- expensive
- indices provide only limited keyword navigation, no direct following of references
- hunching over books for hours is not ergonomic
- not collaborative
- not integrated into a digital writing process
- not everyone enjoys handwriting

Digitizing the reading aspect of academic work seems like a good way to address these problems. But it raises mainly four new problems:

- eye strain or insomnia from extended screen use
- abundance of distractions when reading on a laptop or tablet
- unspontaneous annotation capacities, lack of physical interaction
- mobility limited by battery
- working in sunlight is impractical

There might be other digital setups that work well. If you do not encounter any of these problems, I am not sure you will benefit much from what follows, other than satisfying curiosity. To me anyways, a combination of these issues was a reason for a nagging dissatisfaction. Seeing a fair number of colleagues printing out what they plan to read got me to think that I might not be alone with this dissatisfaction. 

This is all fine and well and I thought so for a long time. The reason that I am writing now is that I think I cracked it. My current solution to these problems centres around a device by a Chinese company called Onyx, the Boox Max 3. It is a 13" (ca. A4) eInk tablet that runs Android 9.0. I bought my first ereader in 2010, and tried to build this setup since at least 2014, when I invested a scholarship into a Boox M96. That ultimately failed, and likewise did later attempts to achieve this with a Kindle. But in late 2020, I wanted to give it another shot (because what do you do in a pandemic?) and I got my hands on a reMarkable 2 eInk tablet. That didn't work either, but I begrudgingly realized that Onyx had improved their devices a good deal. Begrudgingly I decided to give Onyx another shot (it was Christmas after all), and to my amazement, it finally works. 

As you can probably tell, this is not an advertisement for Onyx, and I am not sponsored by anyone. My experience with their M96 made me quite reluctant to ever buy from them again, and I don't think they are a particular nice company. But ultimately, am glad they exist because they offer a product that I needed to do what I want to do. I do not care if I help them sell devices, but if this article is useful to somebody who wants to rethink the ways they engage with their reading materials, that is all I want to achieve. 

## Basics: eInk
Eink screens have been around for a while, mainly known through Amazon's Kindle. But they can also be found in price tags in super markets. If you already know what's up and you've heard of these devices before, just skip this section.

The most common computer screens are backlit: that means they have a (hopefully) uniform light source that is then manipulated to yield what you see on a screen. Liquid crystals use small plates to filter red, green, or blue light out of the backlight - by digitally changing how these crystals are oriented, the image on a screen can change. These changes can happen extremely fast - images can be redrawn hundreds of times per second. But without the backlight, the screen remains black.

The "digital ink particles" that an eInk display rearranges are visible without a backlight. That is plain and simple, but at least for my reading experience, it makes a significant difference. You are not looking into a light. Reflected sunlight is not competing with a backlight - eInk screens work well outside. And the battery life is much longer than for backlit screens, because the screen only draws power when it changes. 

But eInk screens also come with drawbacks: the refresh rate is generally either very slow, or a quickly generated new image shows traces of what has been displayed before ("ghosting", like seeing what is printed on the backside of thin paper). Also, the lack of colour is a deal breaker for some, especially if you rely on e.g. anatomical drawings. The underlying technology also appears to be restrictively protected by patents. In short, eInk devices have remained a niche product, with only a moderate pace of technological progress.

## The Boox Max 3 - and why it is suddenly "affordable"
I ended up buying the Max 3 after a detour. In 2020, the reMarkable 2 was launched - a note taking device with an A5 eInk screen. It was heavily advertised, and apparently I had not opted out of all ad personalizations: I was inundated in advertisements for it, until I actually gave it a try. It was so hyped that I had to wait more than 2 months until my order arrived.

In the end, I returned the device, because of a disappointing reading experience and the limitations in controlling the software. But I had been impressed by the nice writing experience, and started a much too long research into which new devices had come up recently.

It turned out, Boox had just released the Boox Max Lumi, the first A4 eInk device with an integrated light (not a backlight, shining from the side, but I agree it can be confusing). This device was impossible to get hold of, and if it were, it would cost more than €1200. After my bad experience with the company before, I did not want to trust their software or their warranty, and I did not find anything about a trial period. But I read that people had been quite happy with its equally expensive predecessor, the Boox Max 3 - essentially the same device, but with Android 9.0 instead of 10.0, and without the light. But because it lacked the novel killer feature, I could find the Max 3 refurbished on German eBay for €580.  I follow with a short demonstration, and then two things that work well: file synchronization and zotero integration. After that, there are a number of caveats that I want to bring up, because they might be sources of frustration. The first one right here: the official documentation is absolutely useless. You will inevitably end up having to search some basic commands on google (e.g. to use your pen to turn pages, rather than annotate them). 

## Demonstration: pdf reading and annotation
Here are two short demonstration videos to give you an idea of what reading with the Max 3 looks like. I have placed the Max 3 in a tablet holder and, for the second video, added a clip-on light. In a well-lit office or outside, this not necessary.


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jPOH7KFSh0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Here I demonstrate several ways of adding annotations to a pdf article: you can draw directly onto the pdf. <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> You can also select text, which is automatically saved as highlighted. Such highlights can also carry notes. For text input, you can either type on the touch keyboard, tap the keys with your pen, or if you install a keyboard software that supports it, swipe over the keys with your pen. Not demonstrated in the video is the probably most convenient option: to simply connect a bluetooth keyboard. But even  when you are reading on your favourite park bench, writing comments is fast enough. The very best feature: all these comments are natively embedded in the pdf. If you later look at the same document on a laptop, using a very different software, you can just edit the annotations, delete them, add typos, etc. This was not possible in the relatively popular reMarkable 2.

Another area where the reading software in the Max3 beats this competitor, are the text navigation options. You can search for text, use bookmarks, and a very useful fast-scroll bar. To get an idea, see the second video. Although not demonstrated here, this is particularly useful if you are working with longer books, like the Husserliana, that often approach a thousand pages.

## The setup
Much of the setup relies on the freedom to install arbitrary applications from the Play store to this device - it is just a tablet running Android 9.0. This allows for example the integration of newspapers or reading apps (like Pocket). And it gives you access to a full digital library. I briefly comment on how this is achieved.

### File synchronization
File synchronization works via AutoSync for Google Drive. I use this to synchronize my pdf library, which I organize with zotero and its zotfile plugin: it is a simple folder with a good number of files named "AuthorYear_Title.pdf". I am very happy with this setup and it I could move it to a different device or operating system in a flash. 

I always found it helpful to print and read an in progress draft. The physical change in interaction really helps me to get fresh eyes on what I have written, and it stops getting distracted by small reformattings. I guess I will keep printing my drafts now and then, but using the reader to the same end seemed to work as well. This is why, besides the zotero folder, I also synchronize a temporary folder. 
I have defined a tiny bash function (I am using WSL1), that copies an arbitrary file into that location - maybe useful for somebody:
```
# define environment variable:
export BOOXTEMP="/mnt/d/your/path/to/cloud/boox/temp/"

function push_to_boox {
    # copy to boox temporary folder
    echo -n "copying to $BOOXTEMP"
    echo -n ""
    cp -t ${BOOXTEMP} ${1}
    echo -n ""
}
```

### Zoo for zotero
Zoo for Zotero is an android app that allows you to access your zotero collection on an Android device. If you have set up zotfile correctly, you can just navigate your collection from this app and find any text on your device (even if you only remember the title, for example). 


### External reading light
As mentioned above, a main reason that the Boox Max 3 dropped ca. 50% in price has to do with the release of its successor, the Boox Max Lumi. The Lumi is essentially the same device, but it the first A4 reader with an integrated light. Since this is not the kind of device you'd use for reading under a blanket, I don't think it is strictly necessary. 

Of course sometimes light conditions might not be ideal. If you have the money, why not just go with the Boox Max Lumi - it also comes with Android 10 instead. But besides being expensive, the Lumi seemed also very hard to get hold of.  

In the spirit of getting 80% there for 2.5% of the cost, I just bought a clip-on light. It's ugly, but the whole device is not particularly beautiful either. If you're trying to look stylish while working, either the iPad or a collection of hardcover books will get you further anyway.

### Screen protector
One of the annoyances with Onyx is that they do not apply the screen protector in factory - for a device that they (used to) sell upwards of €1000! At least, a basic screen protector ships with the device. But it is so notoriously difficult to apply. Forums are full of people confessing that they just write directly on their screens, or that they ended up getting alternative protectors.

I was tempted to just skip applying the protector altogether, but I am very glad I applied it.  Besides protecting the screen from scratches, it changes the writing feel. But most importantly, it makes for a more diffuse reflection - the blank eInk display is decidedly more shiny than paper, and this was the main thing that initially curbed my enthusiasm.

Here is my unsolicited advice on applying the protector:
- find a dust free environment. Forum advice has it that the steamy air in a bathroom works well, and that's what I followed. But I don't know if my relative success was due o this.
- Really clean the tablet surface - with alcohol - before applying the screen protector. Don't wipe it dry with a paper towel, that will leave dust on the surface.
- trim the edges before applying. The protector has exactly the same size as the screen plus bezel, but it is very hard to fit it exactly. If the protector stands off from the bezel, it will easily peel off. If you slightly trim the protector, application becomes more forgiving, whereas having a little unprotected bezel is no issue. 
### Pens and nibs
The next annoying point, which really makes it hard to feel much enthusiasm when unboxing this device,  is the quality of the pen that it comes with. It is incredibly light and thin, made from a cheap plastic, and has a very hard tip.

I bought a Staedler Noris digital Jumbo, which has a good ergonomic shape and a slightly goofy design (but I understand why they want to keep their recognizable look). This improves the writing feel _a lot_, to the extent that it can compete with the reMarkable 2. To my surprise, however, this seemed to depend more on the little plastic nib that comes with the Staedler pen. Putting one of the Staedler nibs into the original pen also improves that dramatically. While writing, the original pen even seemed slightly more accurate than the Staedler pen. But since I mostly annotate PDFs and don't write much long hand, I prefer the ergonomics of the bigger pen. But it might be feasible to build something better and cheaper by adding weight and a grip tape around the original pen with a better nib.


## Alternative ereaders
### Bigger is better
Many people (within a very small group) debate whether the A4 reader isn't too large. I was almost impressed enough to get an A5 device instead. But at least I am very glad I did not, because it has the following advantages:
- Sharper image. The pixel density of the A4 and A5 devices is the same. But the reading distance from an A4 device is higher, so there are more pixels in view (each pixel covers a smaller solid angle).
- No need for perfect cropping. Your image is still large enough if there is some breathing room (and that makes for more pleasant reading, as LaTeX default layout users will confirm)
- Margin space for notes
- More space for writing/drawing
- Split-screen makes sense, if you prefer to take handwritten notes in a separate document, or need to read two documents side by side.
- It is still mobile. It is not bigger than my ultrabook, fits in any bag or sleeve that you would need to carry for an A5 device anyway.

### Why not a Kindle
The kindle ecosystem determines most of what you can or cannot do. It is great for some tasks. And together with Calibre, it is possible to convert arbitrary HTML content - such as the web view of oxfordscholarship.com to ebooks for your kindle. But sometimes, things are not perfectly smooth. Reading a pdf without having to reflow a document still seems preferrable. Also annotations with .epub or .mobi files are more complicated to integrate wiht other devices.
### Why not the reMarkable 2
I have tried the reMarkable 2 and returned it before getting the Max 3. My main reasons:
- no Bluetooth Keyboard
- no synchronization
- no navigation in documents
- annotations in bitmap layer
- no highlight annotations!
- smaller screen
I think it is a nicely designed device with good hardware, and much better marketing than Onyx. The return was fine as well, I don't know if that would be more complicated for Onyx - so if you are on the fence whether eInk is for you at all, this might be something worth considering. 

## Anticipating disappointments
I am writing a lot of negative things here, so I should maybe reiterate: you can take _all_ your books with you, into the park, and read in the sun while nothing disturbs your peaceful philosophical thinking! It is a dream and I love it. But I want to save you disappointment if 

- The Boox Max 3 looks cheaper than it is
- you will have to do a little reseach and put some effort into setting up your device
- The case is not very good and seems even cheaper - definitely not like the €40 it costs. 
- the Max 3 comes with an HDMI mini input, but sharing a screen in this way or via the DeskSpace Android app is too blurry to be usable. The feature is not really developed.
- The Play store gives you access to an insane number of applications, but the interface of many apps will not work well on an eink screen. So do not bank on using e.g. Adobe Reader. Non-interactive background services, for syncing a folder or calendars, accessing zotero, or just reading on the web, work well.
- Onyx is a dubious company. I have not really researched this part, but their software seems to violate Open Source Licences. 
- My previous experience with the Boox M96 also eroded my faith in Onyx' firmware updates. Sometimes they would introduce new bugs - so I would not install them immediately, and only after searching some forums about whether they introduce new problems
- Onyx releases many devices in quick succession. I would not bank on the Max 3 receiving software updates in 3 years. That said, it runs fine with the latest firmware I installed in January 2021 and I don't see why it would need any updates.

## bonus: emacs via Termux
I also set up termux and installed emacs + doom on my reader. I considered for a moment to write notes in org mode, but I have to admit that this was absolutely unnecessary. For most writing it seems much simpler to rely on, for example, Google Keep. But maybe somebody has a strange niche project in mind, for which the access to a whole battery of terminal tools (like git, rsync, ...) could make all the difference.
